# Market Owner Guide

The Market Owner is a special villager that manages your market and provides various management capabilities. This guide explains how to interact with the Market Owner and use the hybrid GUI system.

## Interacting with the Market Owner

When you right-click on the Market Owner villager, you'll see a custom GUI with several management options. Unlike other custom interfaces, the Market Owner uses a **hybrid approach**:

- The **main menu** uses a custom GUI with clickable options
- The **upgrade system** uses the standard Minecraft villager trading GUI
- All other functions use custom interfaces

## Management Options

### Market Information
At the top of the Market Management menu, you'll see basic information about your market:
- Current level (1-4)
- Founder name
- Number of collectors
- Price modifier

### Market Associates
Associates are players who can help you manage your market. The Market Owner allows you to:
- Add up to 5 associates
- View your current associates
- Remove associates

**Note**: Only the market founder can manage associates.

### Market Permissions
Control who can trade with your collectors:
- Public: Anyone can trade with your collectors
- Private: Only you and your associates can trade

### Security Settings
Manage building permissions within your market area:
- Building: Control who can place blocks
- Breaking: Control who can break blocks

### Market Upgrades

The Market Owner uses a **standard villager trading interface** for market upgrades. When you select this option, you'll be presented with the normal Minecraft trading GUI to purchase upgrades.

#### Upgrade Requirements:

**Level 1 to Level 2:**
- 16 Emeralds
- 64 Wheat

**Level 2 to Level 3:**
- 32 Emeralds
- 16 Gold Ingots
- 128 Wheat (as two separate trades)

**Level 3 to Level 4 (Maximum):**
- 64 Emeralds
- 8 Diamonds
- 192 Wheat (as three separate trades)

After completing all required trades, you'll receive a Market Upgrade Certificate. Right-click while holding this certificate to apply the upgrade to your market.

### Market Settings
Configure visual aspects of your market:
- Toggle special particles for your market villagers
- Toggle market sound effects

### Market Leaderboard
See how your market ranks against others based on:
- Total net worth
- Weekly trade activity
- Market level

The leaderboard shows the top 10 markets across the server, with gold, silver, and bronze indicators for the top three markets.

## Market Level Benefits

Each market level provides significant benefits:

| Level | Max Collectors | Price Modifier | Special Trades |
|-------|----------------|----------------|----------------|
| 1     | 3              | 1.0x           | Basic          |
| 2     | 5              | 1.1x           | Improved       |
| 3     | 7              | 1.2x           | Advanced       |
| 4     | 10             | 1.3x           | Premium        |

## Commands

In addition to the Market Owner GUI, you can use these commands:

- `/bdmarket check` - Visualize market boundaries (shows red wool blocks for 10 seconds)
- `/bdmarket info` - Display information about the market you're in
- `/bdmarket upgrade` - Alternative way to access the upgrade trading interface
- `/bdmarket associate add <player>` - Add a player as a market associate
- `/bdmarket associate remove <player>` - Remove a player as a market associate

## Tips for Market Management

1. **Place Collectors Strategically**: Position your collectors near frequent travel paths to attract more customers.

2. **Upgrade Early**: Higher market levels provide better price modifiers and more collector slots, increasing your earning potential.

3. **Choose Associates Carefully**: Associates can help manage your market, but they also have significant permissions.

4. **Track Your Market Ranking**: Use the leaderboard to see how your market compares to others and set goals for improvement.

5. **Customize Your Market**: Use the settings menu to make your market stand out with particles and sound effects.

6. **Control Access**: Use the permissions system to decide who can trade with your collectors, especially for rare or valuable items.
