# Progression Module

The Progression Module provides a comprehensive advancement system that gives players long-term goals and meaningful rewards for their economic activities. This module features a dual-progression system combining rank advancement with rebirth mechanics for extended gameplay.

## Overview

The Progression Module consists of two interconnected systems that provide both short-term achievement goals and long-term prestige advancement:

### Core Components

- **[Rank System](ranks.md)** - 5-tier progression from Newcomer to Agricultural Expert
- **[Rebirth System](rebirth.md)** - Prestige system with permanent bonuses and exclusive features

## Progression Philosophy

BDCraft's progression is designed around meaningful achievement through economic participation rather than grinding or time-gating:
