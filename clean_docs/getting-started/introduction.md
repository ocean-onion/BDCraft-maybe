BDCraft is a comprehensive Minecraft plugin designed to provide a complete economic and progression system for your server. With its self-contained design, BDCraft offers everything you need without requiring any additional plugins.

## Key Features

## Self-Contained Design

BDCraft is intentionally designed as a self-contained plugin that doesn't rely on or hook into any other plugins. This design choice offers several significant advantages:

### Stability Benefits
- No dependency conflicts to troubleshoot
- Updates to other plugins won't break BDCraft
- Complete control over all features and functions
- Consistent performance across server setups

### Compatibility Protection
BDCraft includes a built-in protection mechanism that prevents competing plugins from interfering with its functionality. This ensures:

- No conflicting economy systems
- No overlapping permissions issues
- Consistent player experience
- Reliable data storage and retrieval

The `block-competing-plugins` option in the configuration is recommended to remain enabled to prevent potential conflicts and ensure optimal performance.

## Modular Architecture

Despite being self-contained, BDCraft features a modular design that allows server administrators to enable or disable specific features:

- **Economy Module**: BD crop system, markets, auctions, and villager trading
- **Progression Module**: Ranks, permanent achievements with GUI, and rebirth systems  
- **Vital Module**: Complete EssentialsX replacement with teleportation, chat, and utilities

Each module can be individually configured or disabled based on your server's needs.

## Core Philosophy

BDCraft provides a unified economic experience where:
- **BD crops with special metadata** drive the entire economy
- **Achievements are permanent** and tracked through an interactive GUI
- **Ranks provide functional benefits** while achievements offer recognition
- **Everything integrates seamlessly** without external dependencies

BDCraft replaces EssentialsX, economy plugins, and chat systems with one cohesive plugin designed for agricultural-economic gameplay.
