## Self-Contained Design

BDCraft is intentionally designed as a self-contained plugin that doesn't rely on or hook into any other plugins. This design choice offers several significant advantages:

### Stability Benefits
- No dependency conflicts to troubleshoot
- Updates to other plugins won't break BDCraft
- Complete control over all features and functions
- Consistent performance across server setups

### Compatibility Protection
BDCraft includes a built-in protection mechanism that prevents competing plugins from interfering with its functionality. This ensures:

- No conflicting economy systems
- No overlapping permissions issues
- Consistent player experience
- Reliable data storage and retrieval

The `block-competing-plugins` option in the configuration is recommended to remain enabled to prevent potential conflicts and ensure optimal performance.

## Modular Architecture

Despite being self-contained, BDCraft features a modular design that allows server administrators to enable or disable specific features:

- Economy Module: Markets, auctions, and villager trading
- Progression Module: Ranks and rebirth systems
- Vital Module: Essential utilities for teleportation, chat, and more

Each module can be individually configured or disabled based on your server's needs.
