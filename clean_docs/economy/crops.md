## Growth Mechanics

### Visual Growth Stages
All BD crop types follow identical visual growth patterns:
- **Stages 1-3**: Grow as melon stems (identical appearance regardless of crop type)
- **Stage 4**: Transform into their respective final forms (ferns, double ferns, double ferns with purple particles)

### Growth Requirements
- **Light Level**: Minimum level 9 required
- **Farmland**: Must be planted on tilled farmland
- **Water**: Water source within 4 blocks required
- **Bone Meal**: Does not work on BD crops
- **Biome**: Growth rate unaffected by biome type

### Growth Acceleration
- **Market Bonus**: 5% faster growth per market level (maximum 25% at level 5)
- **Outside Markets**: No growth bonuses apply
- **Rank Bonuses**: Expert Farmer (5%), Master Farmer (15%), Agricultural Expert (25%)

## Harvesting System

### Harvesting Methods
- **Manual Harvesting**: 1 crop per plant (standard)
- **BD Harvester**: 2 crops per plant (16 diamonds from Expert Farmer+ dealers)
- **Ultimate BD Harvester**: 3 crops per plant (32 diamonds from Agricultural Expert dealers)

### Yield Bonuses
Harvesting yields are enhanced by various factors:
- **Rank Multipliers**: 5% (Farmer) to 30% (Agricultural Expert)
- **Rebirth Bonuses**: +5% per rebirth level (maximum +25%)
- **Donor Benefits**: +10% boost to all rank bonuses
- **Market Level**: Additional trading value bonuses when selling to collectors

## Trading and Economics

### Collector Trading
BD crops can only be sold to Collector villagers within market areas:
- **Emerald Payment**: Physical emeralds added to inventory
- **Server Currency**: Digital currency automatically added to balance
- **Market Bonuses**: Better prices in higher-level markets
- **Reputation**: Trading increases village reputation for better future prices

### Prohibited Sales
- **Auction House**: BD crops cannot be listed in auction house
- **Player Trading**: Direct player-to-player crop sales not supported
- **Regular Villagers**: Only BD Collectors will purchase BD crops
- **Metadata Required**: Only crops with proper BD metadata are accepted by collectors

### Value Calculations
Final crop values are calculated using multiple modifiers:
```
Final Value = Base Value Ã— (1 + Rank_Bonus + Rebirth_Bonus + Market_Level_Bonus + Reputation_Bonus)
```

## Crop Quality System

### Rare Crop Generation
Higher ranks have increased chances of generating higher-tier crops:
- **Master Farmer**: 15% chance to get higher-tier crop than planted
- **Agricultural Expert**: 25% chance to get higher-tier crop than planted
- **Example**: Planting Regular BD Seeds might yield Green BD Crops

### Quality Factors
- **Rank Level**: Higher ranks = better quality chances
- **Market Environment**: Crops grown in markets have enhanced quality potential
- **Tool Usage**: BD Harvesters may influence quality generation
- **Random Events**: Seasonal events can temporarily boost quality rates

## Seed Acquisition

### BD Dealers
Primary source for all BD seeds:
- **Regular Seeds**: 5 seeds for 1 emerald (all ranks)
- **Green Seeds**: 15 emeralds per batch (Farmer+ only)
- **Purple Seeds**: 30 emeralds per batch (Master Farmer+ only)

### Natural Spawning
BD Dealers appear in natural Minecraft villages:
- **Spawn Rate**: 45% chance in any village
- **Profession**: FARMER villager type
- **Identification**: Green "BD Dealer" name tag

### Market Creation
Every player-created market automatically spawns a BD Dealer:
- **Guaranteed Spawn**: Always created with Market Owner

- **Full Inventory**: Stocks all seed types appropriate for player rank

## Cultivation Tips

### Optimal Planting
- **Market Boundaries**: Always plant within market areas for growth bonuses
