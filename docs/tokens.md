# BDCraft Token System

The BDCraft token system provides a specialized second currency that integrates directly with the plugin's progression and economy systems. Unlike generic token systems, BDCraft tokens are deeply woven into the server's ecosystem, providing unique gameplay opportunities and rewards.

## Token Core Mechanics

BDCraft tokens function as a premium currency with several key characteristics:

1. **Server-Bound**: Tokens are tied to the specific BDCraft instance and cannot be transferred between servers
2. **Account-Linked**: Tokens are directly linked to player accounts through BDCraft's internal database
3. **Permission-Controlled**: All token functions are managed through BDCraft's permission system
4. **Progression-Integrated**: Tokens directly interact with the rank and rebirth systems

## Token Economy

### Token Sources

Players can obtain tokens through:

- **Milestone Rewards**: Automatically awarded when reaching specific rank thresholds
- **Achievement Completion**: Granted for completing server achievements
- **Market Leadership**: Earned by owning the most profitable market stands
- **Special Events**: Awarded during server events and competitions
- **Rebirth Bonus**: Significant token reward upon rebirth
- **Admin Grants**: Given by administrators for contributions to the server

### Token Uses

Tokens can be spent on various exclusive benefits:

- **Rank Fast-Tracking**: Skip certain rank requirements using tokens
- **Cooldown Bypasses**: Use tokens to bypass teleport and command cooldowns
- **Exclusive Items**: Purchase items only available through the token shop
- **Market Upgrades**: Expand market capabilities beyond normal limits

## Tokens vs. Economy

BDCraft maintains a clear separation between the main economy (BDCoins) and tokens:

| Feature | Economy (BDCoins) | Tokens |
|---------|-------------------|--------|
| Primary Purpose | General transactions | Special rewards |
| Acquisition | Regular gameplay | Achievements and milestones |
| Usage | Standard purchases | Premium features |
| Transferability | Freely transferable | Limited transfer |
| Storage | Economic database | Player data records |

## Best Practices

For server administrators:

1. **Balance Token Rewards**: Carefully control the rate at which tokens enter the economy
2. **Create Token Sinks**: Ensure there are valuable ways for players to spend tokens
3. **Exclusive Benefits**: Keep token purchases genuinely exclusive without creating pay-to-win
4. **Regular Updates**: Refresh token shop offerings to maintain player interest
5. **Event Integration**: Use tokens as rewards for server events and competitions
