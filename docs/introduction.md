## Philosophy

BDCraft was designed with the following principles in mind:

1. **Self-Contained**: Provides all functionality within a single plugin, eliminating the need for multiple plugins and their potential conflicts.

2. **Modular Design**: Features are organized into modules that can be individually enabled or disabled, giving server administrators complete control.

3. **Performance Focused**: Optimized code ensures minimal impact on server performance even with all features enabled.

4. **User-Friendly**: Intuitive commands and interfaces make the system accessible to players of all experience levels.

5. **Highly Configurable**: Extensive configuration options allow customization to suit any server's needs.

## Plugin Conflict Management

BDCraft is designed to replace several commonly used plugins. When it detects a potentially conflicting plugin, it can automatically disable it to prevent issues. This ensures a smooth experience without requiring manual conflict resolution.

## Technical Architecture

The plugin is built on a modular architecture with:

- **Core Module System**: Manages the loading, enabling, and disabling of modules
- **Internal API Interfaces**: Provide structured communication between modules
- **Configuration Management**: Handles loading and saving of all settings
- **Command Framework**: Processes player commands and permissions
- **Event System**: Facilitates communication between different plugin components

This modular approach makes the plugin easy to maintain and extend while ensuring all components work together seamlessly.
